# 5e-Sheet Resources Plus

This Module allows you to have add more resources to the 5e character sheet.

## Installation

To install, import this [Manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ardittristan/5eSheet-resourcesPlus/master/module.json) into your module browser.

&nbsp;

## Usage

A new resource box called "Resource Count" should appear on the character sheets. If you change the number in this box, the amount of visible resources changes. *(up to 20)*
If you want to have the count be the same everywhere, you could change the local count, and if, as a dm, you want to limit all players to a certain max, you can change the global limit setting.

&nbsp;
